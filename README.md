# ZipMan Basic
A Minimal ZIP Manager For Windows.

## The Story
I saw a YouTube video, in which a file with extension ".zip", was extracted by double clicking on it (in macOS High Serria). After searching for a week, on how to extract a ZIP file by double clicking on it in Windows, I created this software. With it, to extract a ZIP file, just double click it and it should be extracted in a folder with same name as the ZIP file.
